## Weather App Project 🌤️

This is a **Python-based Weather Web Application** built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays it in a user-friendly interface.  
Users can enter any city name to get current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
